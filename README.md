This web-app was created using only HTML, SCSS and Vanilla JS.\
It's mainly made for computer use, still basically responsive for phone use (not optimized).

It's written in *Modular Javascript* using **Webpack** as a bundler and modular CSS with **SASS**.
The goal of the project was to get familiar with **OOP**, _Webpack_ and _SASS_. It makes use of **localStorage** feature.

## How to :microscope:

The app is very intuitive, you can set a lot of info for your todos: just click the task tab and push the _edit_ button, then add your info and click _done_.

You can delete todo just by checking them out (one at a time), you have 3 seconds to change your mind by unchecking them to stop the countdown.

You can filter your todo by **projects**: if you've added a project in your todo, it will show up in the projects' list, ready to filter todos.
You can delete projects by clicking _3 times_ on the project: a countdown of 3 seconds will start, and if you won't re-click 3 times before the end, it will be deleted from the list.

Finally, you can **sort** projects by _date_, _priority_ and _alphabetical_ order: it will sort your todos accordingly to the chosen project filter.

## Stack & Tools  :hammer:

- HTML
- SCSS
- Vanilla JS
- Webpack
- VS Code + ESLint + Node
- Git & GitHub

## What I learned :book:

- **Sass**'s modular writing improved
- **Webpack** configuration optimized
- **ES6 Modules** as the main way to develop the app
- Improved _objects_ manipulation: objects, arrays, functions
- Deepened DOM traversing
- Introduced CRUD method to think about objects
- Prepared to introduce React: element injecting through JS

## What could be improved :mag: 

- Responsiveness for complex functions and designs
- SCSS syntax
